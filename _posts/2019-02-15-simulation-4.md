This is the fourth and last post of a series about the simulation argument, that 
started with [this post](./simulation-1).

In this post we tackle the maximal matching problem. 
Or actually we will show 
why establishing a lower bound for this problem is not as easy as for the 
sinkless orientation problem. 
The real lower bound is in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02441).
 
### Encoding

A maximal matching is a set of edges of the graph, such that no two of these
edges are adjacent, and no two unmatched node are linked by an edge.

A natural encoding for this problem would be to label the edges of the matching 
with a label $A$, and edges not in the matching with a label $B$. 
But this does not work for our setting. 
Instead, we will do the following. 
(As in the previous post we will deal with 2-colored trees.)

* The edges of the matching are labeled with the label $M$. 
* If a white node is not matched then its edges are labeled with $P$. 
These are pointers to matched black nodes.
* The remaining edges are labeled with $O$. 

On the following picture, red edges are for $M$, green edges are for $P$, and 
blue edges are for $O$ (the missing edge should be blue!).

The languages we use are then described by the following polynomials:

* $L_W = MO^{\Delta-1}+P^{\Delta}$,
* $L_B = M(P+O)^{\Delta-1} + O^{\Delta}$.

## Transformation

### Simulation

We perform the simulation on a black node $u$, and get a polynomial $P_u$.  
By definition $P_u\subseteq (M+O+P)^{\Delta}$, and is factorized.

### Product property

As the product rule applies, we know that
$P_u \subseteq M(P+0)^{\Delta-1}+O^{\Delta}$.  
Thus there is at most one factor of $P_u$ with an $M$.

*Claim 1*: This factor is either $(M)$ or $(M+O)$.

*Proof*: Suppose the factor with $M$ has a $P$. 
Then it means that when we develop $P_u$,
there are two monomials $M\times K$ and $P\times K$, with $K$ a polynomial
of degree $\Delta-1$, that does not contain an $M$. 
But the monomial $P\times K$ is not included in 
$M(P+0)^{\Delta-1}+O^{\Delta}$. which contradicts the product property. 

Then we are left with 5 possible sums as factors in $P_u$: 
$(M), (O), (P), (M+O), (P+0)$. 

Now it seems that we cannot get much more out of our properties, so let's try a 
simplification step.

### (Tentative) Simplification step

If we can map $(M+O)$ and $(P+O)$ to a simple label, 
and still match the language, 
then we are done, and we can conclude like in the [previous post](./simulation-3). 
But this is not going to happen. 

Suppose you are in following situation, which is supposed to be easy because 
there is not even a $(P+O)$. (On the picture, every black node writes on its 
adjacent edges.)

![](../assets/couplage-3.png){: .center-image width="60%"}

Ok, let's just take one of the two edges labeled with $M+O$
(let say the one with the smallest port-number on the white node), 
label it with $M$, label the other one with $O$, and we are done.

This does notwork.
The problem is the one we highlighted in the [second post](./simulation-2): 
the edges are not uniformly set-labeled by all the nodes. 
A concrete bad case:

* let $(u,v)$ and $(v,w)$ be the two edges labeled by $(M+0)$ 
* in its simulation, $u$ has (M+O) for both edges, and based on port-numbers, 
decides that $(u,v)$ gets $M$.
* in its simulation $w$ has $(M+O)$ for $(v,w)$, but only $(O)$ for $(u,v)$. Thus 
it labels $(v,w)$ with $M$.

To solve this problem you have to synchronize, and this is forbidden as it takes 
extra time.

## No lower bound this way

So at the end, we cannot conclude like in the case of sinkless orientation. 

Comments on that:

* This makes sense: actually there is a $O(\Delta)$ 
algorithm for this problem, thus no $\Omega(\log n)$ lower bound exists. 

* The above alone does not prove that there is no $\Omega(\log n)$ lower 
bound: we could use another definition of the problem, or we could have tried 
more exotic label replacement ($M$ transformed into $P$, or whatever). 

* If you want to prove a $\Omega(\Delta)$ lower bound then you need to be 
smarter. In particular you need that, after the transformation, the language is 
different. Basically there should be a parameter that starts with something like 
$\Delta$ and decreases at each transformation. 
For that, see [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02441)!
