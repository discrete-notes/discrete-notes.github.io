## Tverberg's theorem

For geometric algorithms in the plane, one sometimes has go through case by case 
analysis along the lines of "if this point is below this line, then this and 
that intersect, if not then...". 
Such proofs are a bit boring and it is easy to make mistakes. 
So when you have a general theorem that does the work for you, it's good news. 
Tverberg's theorem looks like a theorem that could be useful from this point of 
view. 

[Tverberg's theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tverberg%27s_theorem) states 
a condition such that the convex hulls of several sets of points intersect. 
Precisely: in a $d$-dimensional euclidian space, for any integer $r$, for any 
set of $(d+1)(r-1)+1$ points, there exists a partition in $r$ subsets such that 
the convex hulls of the $r$ subsets intersect. 
The picture below present the case $d=2$ and $r=3$, for $(d+1)(r-1)+1=7$ points, 
and for one less point. 
In this last case the theorem does not hold (we just show one partition).

[I saw the name of this theorem on the SOCG accepted papers list, unfortunately
the paper is not available online, and we don't know what they do with this 
theorem.]

## Criteria for fair item assignment

[Fair item assignement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_item_assignment) 
consists, given items and participants, to assign the items to the participants 
in a fair manner, for some definition of fair. There are many variants of the 
problem and many ways to define fairness. 

Here are a few fairness criteria, to decide if the assignment is fair or not:

* Max-min fair-share ("I cut, you choose"): every participant is least as happy 
as if she had cut the set of items first, and then let all the other 
participants choose before her.
* Max-min fair-share ("You cut, I choose"): the same but reversed, that is every
participant is at least as happy as if someone else did the cut, and she could 
decide first.
* [Envy-freeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envy-freeness): 
no participant would like to change her items for the items of 
another participant.
* Competitive equilibrium from equal incomes: there exists a price for each item
such that, given the same budget, the participants would choose different items.

[I learnt about this at the CS PhD seminar of Sorbonne university, by Parham 
Shams.]

## Tai chi problem 

When crossing the 
[Jardin des plantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jardin_des_plantes) 
I often witness the following kind of scene.

![](../assets/taichi.JPG){: .center-image width="90%"}

It is people practising [taichi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tai_chi). 
There is a professor in front of the group (with a white cap on the picture)
who is showing the movements, and everybody is supposed to perform them in 
real-time (it's pretty slow).

The thing is: people on the first row can see the professor, but the ones on the 
back cannot, so they follow the moves of the people on the rows closer to the 
professor. Therefore there is a kind of wave from the front to the back. 
Maybe it can make an interesting problem: how fast does the wave propagate, is 
it close to a straight line, how does it depend on the size of the participants?

## Core algorithms deployed

It is common as a reseacher to have doubt about how useful your research is. 
In my case, I sometimes wonder whether the algorithmic problem we try to solve 
really have an impact. 
It could well be the case that the algorithmic problems that 
are really useful are the ones that have only basic answers.
That is, we focus on the sweet spot between trivially easy and trivially hard 
problems, and this set could have an empty intersection with real-world 
questions.

I was really happy to discover a few years ago 
[the topic "core algorithms deployed"](https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/19759/core-algorithms-deployed)
on stack exchange,
that removes any doubt on this regard.

## Numerical errors in missile trajectories

I discovered in the introduction of
[this  PhD thesis](https://www.lri.fr/~melquion/doc/19-hdr.pdf) the following 
story, illustrating why computer arithmetics is important and difficult. 

In 2011, a US "[defence missile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missile_defense)" 
missed a "real missile", with tragic consequences, 
because of computer arithmetic. 
The basic reason is the following. 
There used to be a software doing the trajectory computations, with rounding 
operations, including on the time variable. This  variable slowly shifted 
compared to the real time because of these rounding. 
It sounds dangerous, but it was actually ok: 
the trajectory computations would consider fast movements 
so between the start and end of the trajectory, the shift was negligible, and 
the absolute time did not matter. The problem is that part of the system was 
updated with more accurate time variable. Then the shift would not be the same 
in two different parts of the system. Then the shift would not cancel out and 
this was the bug.  

[A better explanation can be found in 
[this document](http://www-users.math.umn.edu/~arnold/disasters/Patriot-dharan-skeel-siam.pdf).
The PhD thesis has a more light-hearted story about gamers trying to finish a 
video game level without jumping, and using a slow shift of a platform 
(also due to rounding errors) to do so.]


## Max cut and planar graphs

Two results about [max-cut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_cut) that I 
didn't know:

* a cut is maximum if and only if its complement is a minimum odd-circuit cover 
(this is easy to check, see for example 
[here](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~glencora/wiki/uploads/planar-max-cut.pdf),
or simply stare a bit at the picture below.)

* This can be used to obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for max-cut in planar 
graphs.

[I got aware of this by
[this preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.06061)
which presents an algorithm for max-cut whose complexity is parametrized by the 
[number of crossing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_number_(graph_theory)) 
in the drawing of the graph.]
