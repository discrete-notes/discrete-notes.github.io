## Conference model survey

An online survey has been created [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfOmbqTTfQfUYEXADCLLqat-OAl7XUh8gFceg27uDfpr_NaaQ/viewform) to gather the opinions of the distributed 
computing community about its model of conferences. Topics include:

* changing from one deadline to three deadlines a year. Basically it's like 
having the reviewing process made three times (with a smaller number of papers), 
and then having a conference with the papers accepted to any of the three phases. 
* collocating the two main conferences of the domain.
* changing the format (more keynotes, or shorter talks etc.)
* transitioning to a journal model.

Details can be found in the survey.  

## Paper presentation videos

One of the side topics of the survey is the possibility for the 
authors to upload a video presenting their papers. It's something I have thought
of doing for my papers, but finally didn't try. 

Till Miltzow is a researcher in graph theory and he records a talk for every 
paper he has, see [here](https://sites.google.com/view/miltzow/publications). 
I think it's good!

## The PolyTCS project

You may know the [Polymath Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath_Project),
which is a project from the math community. It consists in choosing an open problem, 
and then working on this problem in a massively collaborative way: everything is
public, and everyone can help. This project has been quite successful, with great
collaborations, and great papers. 

A similar project has been launched in TCS: 
[The PolyTCS project](https://polytcs.wordpress.com/).
The first problem is about boolean functions, see 
[here](https://polytcs.wordpress.com/2019/11/01/the-entropy-influence-conjecture/).

## FORC conference

A new conference in TCS: [Symposium on the Foundations of Responsible Computing (FORC)](https://responsiblecomputing.org/forc-2020-call-for-paper/). Topics include privacy, fairness and electoral processes. 

## Symbolic computations in python

I recently had to do a lot of small computations on toy examples. To check the 
computations, I wanted to have some symbolic math software, but the usual
ones (e.g. Maple) are big machines, and often not open-source. If you are in the 
same situation, python with [sympy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) is a 
good choice.

## Pull requests for this blog

This blog is a github page, that is, it works as a git repository. 
I recently got some pull requests for it, from my friend 
[Lilian Besson](https://perso.crans.org/besson/me/index.fr.html). 
Pull requests is a way to suggest changes, e.g. correct a typo. It is very 
convenient (on my side): I just have to pull these commits. 
If you want to know more and correct one of the many typos of this blog, you can 
take a look at [this page](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-first-pull-request-on-github/).
