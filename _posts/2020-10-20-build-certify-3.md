This is the third and last post about building and certifying solutions, 
in particular for the minimum spanning tree problem. The first post is 
[here](./build-certify-1.html).
In the [second post](./build-certify-1.html), 
we saw the classic way to build an MST in a distributed manner, using 
fragments. And we saw that one can build a certification of this MST 
during its computation. 
Unfortunately, this certification is not optimal for all ranges of weights.
There exists another certification, that is optimal for all weight range,
but it is computed *after* the MST.

In this post, we argue that this two-phase approach might be unavoidable.

## What does it mean to build and certify at the same time?

It is unclear at first what it means to build and certify "at the same 
time". Indeed, any algorithm can look like a black box, that outputs the
MST and its certification at the same time. One can imagine for example, 
an algorithm with a tentative MST, that would be certified, and only 
then copied in some other variables that would be the "output variables".

As such, there might not be a good general definition for the intuitive 
idea that the certification is a trace of the execution. But for MST, 
all the classic efficient distributed algorithms that I know of build on
the idea of merging fragments little by little. Then we will say that 
a certification is "simultaneous" if it is incremental, in the sense that
after each merge, one can append a sublabel to the current certificate. 
At the end, the certificate should be the concatenation of the pieces 
associated with the different merges. 

Actually, this idea can go a bit beyond MST. Basically, in the MST 
algorithm based on fragments, the nodes discover more and more of the 
graph and commit to the choice of some edges, little by little. 
Simultaneous certification means that every time the algorithm looks 
"further" it has to certify what has been done already, and this might 
make sense for other tasks than MST. 

##Â About fragments names 

We want to show that simultaneous certification may not be possible for
MST if we want the optimal certificate size. The optimal size is 
$\Theta(\log n \log W)$ where $W$ is the maximum weight as proved by 
XXX. For small weights e.g. $W=\log n$ this is smaller than the scheme 
presented in the previous post, which uses $\Theta(\log^2 n)$ bits.

The reason why the previous scheme uses $\Theta(\log^2 n)$ bits is 
simple: a node can be in $\log n$ successive fragments, and for each of 
them it stores an identifier on $O(\log n)$ bits. 

But why do we need these IDs? 
We need to differentiate between fragments because
when we 
want to use an edge to perform a merge, it is important to be able to 
tell whether the two endpoints of the edge are different fragments (and
then the merge is legit) or whether they are in the same fragment (and 
then the merge is forbidden). 
Taking an ID from each fragment as its "name" is an easy way to do that, as IDs 
are distinct by definition.

## Node names in the optimal scheme

The optimal does not use exactly the same strategy of following the algorithl, 
but on a high level the approach is similar, and in particular the core of the 
scheme is a clever way to name nodes. Before we continue with our discussion, 
it is interesting to give some insights about these node names.

To make this more concrete, consider that the labels are built by a "prover".
The prover first looks at the tree, and chooses a node to be the center. 
A center should be such that if 
we root the tree at the center, then the subtrees have size at most half of the 
full tree. Here is our example from the previous post.

![](assets/fragments-names-0.png){: .center-image width="80%"} 

On this graph, the prover chooses D as a center. 
Here the subtrees have sizes 3, 1, 1 and 4, and the full tree has size 10, thus
the condition is satisfied. 

Now the second step is that the prover labels the $k$ subtrees from 1 to $k$, in
in decreasing order of size.

![](assets/fragments-names-1.png){: .center-image width="80%"} 

Then the same operation is repeated in the subtrees. For the subtrees of size 1, 
the center is obviously the only node of the subtree. For the two other subtrees, 
the prover chooses again a center, and labels the subtrees.

![](assets/fragments-names-2.png){: .center-image width="80%"} 
 
And then again for in the last non-trivial subtree.

![](assets/fragments-names-3.png){: .center-image width="80%"} 

At the end, the prover assigns to each node a name that is just the 
concatenation of the successive subtree numbers it has received.

## Why are these node names useful, checkable and small?

One can use the names to reconstruct the sequence of splits. In particular, two
adjacent nodes can check at which point they were separated: it is the first 
position in their names were the number differs. For example on the the picture 
above two nodes on the right have names "111" and "12." respectively, thus they 
were in the same subtree after the first split, but they were in different 
subtrees after the second split. 

Now, this is interesting: if we consider the sequence bottom-up instead of 
top-down we have fragments merging instead of splitting, and the node names allow
the nodes to know whether or not they are in the same fragment at that point. 
This is what the IDs were useful for in the previous scheme. 

An important point here is that we need to check that these names are correct
and that the prover does not fool the nodes. But this is easy: as in a split (or
a merge when looking in the reverse direction) there is a special node, the 
center, that can see the name of the subtrees and check that they are different. 
(Given some small additional pieces of information it can also check that the 
numbering is in the reverse order of sizes, but let's not go into this.)

Let's take a look at the size of these names. First, we need to write the 
subtree numbers in binary. Thus at first sight, we again get 
some $\log^2n$ term, because each subtree number can be as large as $\log n$, 
and there can be as many as $\log n$ successive splits. But actually, it is 
known that numbering the subtrees in the reverse order of size allows to get 
names in $O(\log n)$ bits. 

This is great: we have a technique to get compact fragment names by basically 
having node names that encode all the fragment names. Of course now the problem 
is that to choose this names we need to go top-down, with the computation of the
 centers etc. 
 
## Why couldn't we get small names during computation? 

Suppose we want to avoid using IDs for naming the fragments, and we want to find
a smart way to assign names to the fragments. The essential part is that these 
names should be different. 

Let us recall the two properties that we noted about the classic MST algorithms:

* It could be that a fragment merges with just one other fragments, but it can 
also be two or actually $Theta(n)$.

* The place where the fragments merge is uncontrolled: a fragment 
can be merging with one fragment in some places and with another 
fragment very far away. 

If we take the vanilla version of the algorithm, with these two properties, 
it seems difficult to get small names that can be checked. Indeed, in this case,
the following scenario can occur. There is central fragment that is a long path,
and at each endpoint, $k$ fragments are merging. The prover provides some names 
for these fragments, that are supposed to be different. 

![](assets/MST-communication.png){: .center-image width="80%"} 

But now, how do the nodes check that these names are different? Maybe the same 
name is used, once on the left and once on the right. If the prover can chose 
arbitrary names in $[1,2k]$, then having a compact way to certify that the sets 
of names are disjoint is impossible. Indeed it would contradict a classic 
result for (non-deterministic) disjointness problem in communication complexity.

How to avoid this? One way is to force that only two fragments can merge at a 
time. But then the process can be slow. To see that consider a path in 
which the weights are increasing. At the first phase the first and the second 
nodes merge, but the third node cannot merge with the second and has to wait. 
And actually all the nodes except the first two have to wait. At the second phase,
only the third node can merge etc. At the end there can be as many as $n$ phases,
and then it seems hard to get small labels. 

A second way to avoid the communication problem is to control better the names 
of the fragments. Indeed, for the communication complexity reduction to work, 
the names on the two sides need to be arbitrary. If we make sure that the names 
on the right begin with 0 and the names on the left begin with 1, then it does 
not work. And indeed it is easy to check that one can certify the difference 
between these names with a few bits. But now, remember that to get small names
the optimal scheme had to use a naming related to the fragments sizes. And this 
would not work with the O/1 idea: there is no reason why all the large fragments
should be on one side. 

So here are so elements that make me think that simultaneous certification is 
not possible if we want optimal size. But maybe something smarter can be done!
