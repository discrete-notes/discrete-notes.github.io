It has been a while since the last set of "monthly" notes on this blog. 
Here is a set of notes about scientific life without science: new 
journals, conference and collaboration experiments, and sociology of research.

## Two new open-access journals

Two new (full/diamond/golden) open access journals are being launched!

[TheoretiCS](https://theoretics.episciences.org/) is a new top journal 
for theoretical computer science. Its advisory board consists of one
representative for each of the main TCS conferences (including Jennifer Welch 
for PODC). I guess it is meant to compete with JACM and JComp in terms of 
prestige, while focusing on TCS. It is published by the (non-profit) 
TheoretiCS foundation, is an overlay journal (ie the papers are basically 
stored on the arxiv) and is hosted by the episciences platform (exactly 
like the DMTCS journal). (TheoretiCS has not been officially launched yet, 
thus does not accept submissions at the moment.)

[Computing in geometry and topology](https://www.cgt-journal.org/index.php/cgt)
is another new journal, whose scope is computational geometry and topology
in a broad sense. CGT will publish both standard papers and surveys, and it 
already accepts submissions. From what I understood, geometry already has 
one open-access journal, 
[Journal of Computational Geometry](https://jocg.org/index.php/jocg), but 
it is only for the very best papers in the field, and I guess the new 
journal will also publish papers that are "just great".


## A blog track at ICLR

The AI conference [ICLR](https://iclr.cc/) has a 
[new track for blog posts](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2022/CallForBlogPosts).
The call for paper has some loose guidelines, but basically anything that we
consider to be a blog post (in the conference scope) is appropriate. 
One does not need to have a blog to participate: it can be just one post, 
that will appear on the conference blog.

The ICLR blog track committee has its own blog, and explains in a post the 
motivation for this new track. It basically says that blog posts are very 
important in AI, because of the noisy reviewing process, and the huge 
number of papers written each year, but because blogs are not recognized 
enough, there is little incentive to work on them. THis track is meant to
mitigate this effect.
The [post](https://iclr-blog-track.github.io//2021/09/08/blog-posts-as-conference-contributions/)
actually contains more insights and motivations, and is very interesting. 

Blogs are probably more popular in AI than in TCS, so maybe it wouldn't 
work in TCS, but maybe at some point it would be worth trying to have such 
a track.


## A simplicity track at ESA

A few years back, a new satellite conference for SODA was established, SOSA, 
focusing on simplicity in algorithms. It seems that it was a success, 
because now the European sister of SODA, ESA, is having a new track with the 
same focus on simplicity. 

I've never submitted a paper to SOSA, but I really like the idea, and I 
think that simplicity is indeed something that we need should be highlighted 
and rewarded.

## Mathematics morality

Thanks to [the 11011110 blog](https://11011110.github.io/blog/) I discovered
[Mathematics, morally](http://eugeniacheng.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/cheng-morality.pdf), 
an essay by [Eugenia Cheng](http://eugeniacheng.com/). 
It is about all these situations where we say 
things like "it is morally true", "morally, what happens is" etc. 
I actually avoid saying this, because I've heard people being very angry 
about that ("Do you know what is morality!?"). 
But Cheng has a very nice explanation of what it means, and 
why it is relevant to use it. She also writes about the hiatus there is 
between mathematicians and philosophers of mathematics. 
The essay is 20+ pages, but I really recommend it.

## Supercollaboration

Supercollaboration is a way of doing research popularized by Erik Demaine 
and his colleagues. Basically, they wrote soft rules that formalize what 
is happening in workshops that are really "workshops" and not "listenshops". 
The format is: a small crowd gather in some place, present open problems, 
people work on these problems. In case they solve problems, each 
participant decide whether (s)he considers (s)he is an author or not, and 
until a possible publication all the discussions are confidential (ie
communication outside the group can only happen if the group agrees). 

I've experimented such events several times this year, and really enjoyed it. 
It was within the graph theory community where it seems to be more common than 
in mainstream TCS.
 
The people promoting supercollaboration wrote a very interesting and concrete
"How to", explaining how to organized and drive such collaboration, in 
several formats. See [here](http://erikdemaine.org/supercollaboration/howto.pdf). 

## Mistakes in papers

It has been on the Internet for a while already, but I haven't blogged about it 
yet. Thomas Vidick wrote a 
[blog post](https://mycqstate.wordpress.com/2020/09/29/it-happens-to-everyonebut-its-not-fun/) 
about a major mistake in one of his papers, detailing the scientific, 
personal, and social aspects of it. 
A very nice read.
