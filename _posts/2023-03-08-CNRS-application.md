This post is about application to CNRS, a French research institution. 
If you are not French and want to know more about CNRS, let me redirect you
to [this blog post](https://games-automata-play.com/blog/applying_cnrs/) 
by [Nathanael Fijalkow](https://games-automata-play.com/), that explains 
it all very well. I will just highlight that non-French people are very 
welcome, that there is no need to speak French, and that the positions 
come with no teaching duties. 

In this post I want to share the documents I used for my applications in 2022: 

* [report on past research](https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/lfeuilloley/autre/CNRS-rapport-2022.pdf), 
* [research project](https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/lfeuilloley/autre/CNRS-projet-2022.pdf),

and the slides of my two applications:

* [2022 interview slides](https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/lfeuilloley/autre/CNRS-slides-2022.pdf),
* [2021 interview slides](https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/lfeuilloley/autre/CNRS-slides-2021.pdf).

These are all in French, but automatic translation can probably give some 
decent versions of the report and project, and the slides are heavely based
on drawings.

The reason why I am sharing this is that when I prepared my applications and 
interviews, it was very useful to have some examples, in particular the ones 
of [the post](https://games-automata-play.com/blog/applying_cnrs/) I 
already mentioned. When I applied for the first time, I had no idea what an 
application could look like, and having a few different examples was 
reassuring and mitigated the writer's block.

Now, I want to strongly highlight that this is an example, in *the sense of 
an illustration/instance*, and not *in the sense of a model*.
First, there are tons of things to be improved there. Second, there 
are thousands of ways of writing this kind of document, every researchers 
has different strengths and tastes. For example, I like making links 
between different areas and drawing stuff, which is why the slides look 
like they do. 

I hesitated for quite a long time before making this public. I hope I will 
not look too stupid if, for example, some research directions I propose ends 
up being complete non-sense. The reason I do it is because I think these 
are useful to applicants, and that some applicants do not have 
access to people who have applied before and can send them files, slides, 
and advice, which is very unfair. 

Also, I'd like to take the opportunity to say a word about the 
questions of the committee, because this was mysterious and a bit scary to 
me. The questions I had were of two types. 

* *Making sure that some aspect is solid enough.* For example, if you have a 
very good publication in a field a bit far from your expertise, be prepared 
to explain what you did, in which way you were useful, etc. Another example 
is: a part of your project is connected to a field you do not know (eg A.I. 
or biology), then be prepared to explain how you are going to work there, 
with which experts of this area. 

* *Relating to a topic the committee members knows.* The people who will ask 
the most of the questions are people who do not know your topic, but 
work in a close area. Think about someone who could go to the same 
conference, but not attend the same sessions. It is difficult for them to 
ask very meaningful technical questions on your core topic. So they will 
probably ask questions about a topic that is in their area of expertise and 
related to your work, although not your specific area. You can try to 
imagine what these questions can be.

If you are applying, good luck to you! Bon courage!
