Today an updated version of my bibliography of papers about distributed 
approximation is out 
(see [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08510.pdf) on the arxiv). 

## What it is 

The idea is to have a list of papers, with a few items for each, telling 
what is the setting, the main result, and how it compares with the other 
papers. The origin of this one is a project,
for which it was important to understand previous work, and the literature 
was very confusing. So I did the first version of this bibliography for 
my colleagues and myself, and then when we finally abandoned the project I 
thought it would be nice to make it readable and public. 

Note that it is not a survey: I am not an expert of the area, I don't explain 
any proof technique, do not highlight any open problem. It is just an 
annotated list of papers. 

## Why it's useful	

I think that such documents are useful, and that we should spend more time 
writing them, even if they are not counted as publications. 

First, it provides a good tool when 
starting a project in an area that one does not know well. It provides 
an exhaustive list of the papers of the area, which allows to understand (1) 
the history of a problem, (2) the state of the art (at the date of the 
latest update), and possibly (3) which papers are to be credited for a given 
technique. In this sense, it makes the area easier to reach, and avoids 
having only a small set of authors being able to understand what's going on. 

Second, such bibliographic documents allow for a more healthy citation 
system. Without them, one is often in a problematic situation for citing papers:

* Either you cite all the papers of the area that you know, and then you do 
it in a way that is useless for readers (long lists of citations, without 
any comments, and without the promise that it is meant to be exhaustive).

* Or you cite specific papers, and then maybe some people will be pissed of, 
but more importantly you
might not cite the most relevant ones, but only the ones you see cited often. 
(I can see this clearly in my citation counts, I have some papers that are 
always cited as "there is also this other stuff done in area", 
while others would actually be much more relevant. I guess that, when 
in a hurry, one just copies the citations from previous papers.)

* Or you cite basically nothing (which is more graph theory style) but then 
you do not give any help to the reader to understand the area, except for your
result (and this 1964 paper of Erdös, in which you found the conjecture).
