A short post about pronouns on name tags. 

For [DISC 2023](https://www.disc-conference.org/wp/disc2023/), 
[Tijn de Vos](https://sites.google.com/view/tijndevos/) suggested to have 
pronouns on name tags. At first I was afraid that people would be very 
skeptical, but the organizers were enthusiatic, and I heard no complaint 
about it during the conference. 

There was simply a field in the registration form for pronouns, and people 
could decide to leave it blank. The name tags looked like the one below 
(which is draft version in Italian and English).

I guess every conference should consider having pronouns on name tags.
