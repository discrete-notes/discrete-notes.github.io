A short post to advertise a column in SIGACT News written with
[Tijn de Vos](https://sites.google.com/view/tijndevos/) (invited by Dan 
Alistarh):

[The Environmental Cost of Our Conferences: The CO2 Emissions due to Travel at PODC and DISC](https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/lfeuilloley/autre/SIGACT-column.pdf)

This follows from the work we did as environmental chairs of DISC 2023. 
It contains an analysis of the carbon footprint of PODC and DISC, as well 
as the evaluation of several other conference formats, and recommendations to
steering committees.
