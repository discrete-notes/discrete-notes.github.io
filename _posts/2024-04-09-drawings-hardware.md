Continuying a series of posts about how I do my pictures. Today about the
hardware I use. 

I started drawing for research/blog/talks on a Samsung tablet (therefore
with my finger, not a stylus), using the first drawing software I found.
It worked pretty well. For example the picture below was made at that 
time, and looks ok to me.

The important feature is that your drawing software supports layers, as 
said in the previous post. 

Nowadays, I use a graphics tablet with a stylus. It is "black" tablet, not 
one with an LCD display. So I need to plug it to the computer, and look at 
the screen of a computer, while moving the stylus on the tablet. It looks 
weird at first, but when gets used to it quasi instantly. (Tablets with 
screens are much more expensive.)

Specifically, I use a Repaper tablet by iskn, although I suspect any tablet 
would suffice for my modest needs. 
Actually, for me this tablet is a bit annoying because it is not supported by 
linux (my usual OS), so I needed to go back and forth between windows and 
linux. I've heard that Wacom tablets work well with linux (or ubuntu linux at least).

I guess the bottom line is that for simple drawings you don't need fancy 
stuff.
