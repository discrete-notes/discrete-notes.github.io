A quick non-technical post to kick off the new academic year. 
In short: it can be good to take small breaks regularly.

I'm not a fanatic of "techniques to work efficiently": most are unconvincing
and it's often dubious what is meant by "efficiency".
But there is one small thing that I do regularly, and makes me happier at 
the end of the day. It's called Pomodoro technique, and it's simply 
about working in the following schedule: 

* Work for 25 minutes;
* Take a 5-minute break;
* Repeat (with a longer break every four cycles or so). 

The technique gets its name from the tomato-shaped kitchen timer used by 
its "creator" (pomodoro is Italian for tomato).

The specific numbers (25-5) are of course unimportant, but there are two aspects that 
are good to me:

* It often happens to me that as the hours go by, I'm getting distracted, 
taking uncontrolled breaks (doomscrolling the news, or getting depressed
reading the publication lists of my hyper-productive colleagues);
then feeling guilty, and not allowing myself to take a real break. 
Taking real short breaks regularly is a good way to avoid this downward 
spiral.

* Cutting time into small periods gives an opportunity to change activity. 
For example, without a break I can go "I just need a bit more time to 
finish this" for a full afternoon, while if I realize I have already spend 
three segments on some non-urgent thing, I can force myself to switch to 
something else, even if "I just need 5 more minutes". 

I discovered this technique while searching for background music. Some videos are 
designed to follow the Pomodoro technique, like
