I recently rediscovered a youtube channel called 
[Polylog](https://www.youtube.com/@PolylogCS), by 
[Richard Hladík](https://rihl.uralyx.cz/), 
[Václav Rozhoň](https://n.ethz.ch/~rozhonv/), 
and [Václav Volhejn](https://vvolhejn.com/). This tiny post is just a pointer to that awesome channel, that covers 
interesting TCS topics, with beautifully crafted animations, and engaging stories.

I especially liked the videos about:

* [The A* algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A60q6dcoCjw)

* [Avi Wigderson's derandomization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZck0N_T9Cs)

There is also [a blog](https://vasekrozhon.wordpress.com/) with some 
additional details.
