UPDATE: As a consequence of this post, PODC CfP was modified to mention a 
form of mandatory attendance. I'm leaving the original version of the post 
here, and might have another post about the current formulation of the CfP.

UPDATE 2: There is now a long workshop organized before PODC. 

[PODC 2025](https://www.podc.org/podc2025/), the flagship conference of 
(the theory of) distributed computing will take place in Huatulco, a 
seaside resort in southern Mexico.

This location choice has faced criticism due to its high carbon footprint. 
For instance, the carbon-equivalent emissions associated with travel will 
be more than double those for a conference in Paris.
(See [the report](https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/lfeuilloley/autre/SIGACT-column.pdf) 
we wrote with Tijn de Vos. At the time we only knew we only knew that the 
conference would be in Mexico, so we assumed Mexico City.)
Additionally, it is unclear whether the conference will significantly 
benefit the local research community, given that only a small number of 
researchers in Mexico specialize in this area. No discussions, as far as I 
know, have taken place about organizing events to massively engage local students, 
such as satellite workshops. Furthermore, the location was not initially 
suggested by local researchers but by individuals from other countries who 
have fond memories of previous conferences in Mexico.

Anyway, this choice is made. Now, a way to mitigate the carbon impact 
is to relax mandatory in-person attendance (which I 
[blogged about](https://discrete-notes.github.io/mandatory-attendance) 
earlier). I proposed to the steering committee that the call for papers 
explicitly allow the program committee chair to permit remote presentations 
on a case-by-case basis. While this suggestion represents only a small 
step—since the chair could deny all requests—it would have been a move in 
the right direction. The recently published call for papers actually does not 
mention mandatory attendance at all. While most people
likely expect papers to be presented on-site, there is no formal basis for 
removing a paper from the proceedings if the author opts to present online.

I therefore encourage those hesitant to travel to Mexico to request online 
presentations. 

One might ask why one would submit to a conference if not to participate in
that conference. I agree it makes little sense a priori, but our academic 
system makes it so that having a PODC paper can change your career. Some 
countries, for recruiting academics, simply compute a weighted average of 
the publications, and PODC usually has a high weight, even compared to 
DISC or Distributed Computing (respectively, the second flagship conference 
of the area, and the main journal). Since it is impossible to change this in a 
few month, we have to adapt to it. 

A second issue is that online presentation can be less engaging than 
on-site talks because of technical issues, less dynamic talks, and 
lack of interaction at coffee breaks. My bet is that if one does things 
right, an online talk can overall be better than an average on-site talk. 
I would urge anyone planning to present online to make big efforts to 
make the experience of the participants as good as possible. In particular, 
having a great talk, prepared well in advance, rehearsed with diverse 
audiences, and incorporating feedback. Also having recorded 
versions of different formats (teaser, 20 minutes, extended version) would be 
great. Finally, being very responsive with questions: being connected to the 
PODC-DISC zulip channel, promptly answering questions via email, offering 
video calls to discuss specific aspects. Of course this is more work than 
sketching half-baked slides a few hours before your talk, but think about all 
the time you will not spend in planes and airports! (From Lyon, where I am, 
the round trip is almost 40 hours, see
[skyscanner](https://www.skyscanner.fr/transport/flights/lys/hux/250614/?adultsv2=1&cabinclass=economy&childrenv2=&inboundaltsenabled=false&outboundaltsenabled=false&preferdirects=false&rtn=0))


As for my plans, I decided not to submit to PODC 
this year (being in the PC, and having nothing that would 
be ready without rushing). However, I am happy to assist anyone making the 
decision to present online both on the diplomatic side and for preparing 
a great presentation.
