A short post about two (hopefully) useful webpages on my site.

## List of conflicts of interest 

I maintain a list of my conflicts of interest 
[here](https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/lfeuilloley/COI.html). 
It follows the standard 
COI definition used by conferences: PhD advisor/student, close or current 
collaborators, and co-authors of papers published within the last two years.

This list is particularly useful to me when submitting papers or serving 
on a program committee, as I can simply copy-paste it to disclose my COIs.

I hope it is also helpful to others. For example, if you're considering 
asking me to review a paper but suspect a conflict of interest, you can 
easily verify this by checking the webpage (instead of manually searching 
DBLP, for instance) 

## Reviews

I also maintain the list of all the reviews I have done, as a set of conference
and journal names, sorted by year. You can view it 
[here](https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/lfeuilloley/reviews.html).

This is satisfying for me, since it leaves a record of the work done.
I hope it’s also useful to others when assessing whether I’m a suitable 
candidate to review specific papers.

I started this because I was wondering what was the standard review
load for researchers. I still don’t know the answer, but at least others 
can see how much I contribute. Also since reviewing is important work, 
often undervalued, I believe it’s important to acknowledge this work 
somewhere.
