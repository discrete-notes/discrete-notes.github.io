Thanks to
[Marie Kerjean](https://lipn.univ-paris13.fr/~kerjean/) 
on mastodon, I got aware of a conference on gender and science at 
Coll√®ge de France. If you understand French, there is plenty of interesting
talks to watch on various fields of research, see 
[here](https://www.college-de-france.fr/fr/agenda/grand-evenement/genre-et-sciences).

In this blog post, I'd like to highlight a tiny part of
 [the talk](https://www.college-de-france.fr/fr/agenda/grand-evenement/genre-et-sciences/la-discrimination-contre-les-femmes-scientifiques-une-histoire-recente-inachevee) 
 by [Esther Duflo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esther_Duflo)
(a prominent French economist working at MIT). In general, the talk is about 
all the mechanisms that explain why there are so few women in many fields 
of research, with a focus on economics. For several such mechanisms I was 
not very surprised, having heard about the topic before (although it is still 
nice to see it discussed with solid references). But there was one phenomenon
did not know about, and it's about bias in committees deciding about 
academics' careers (e.g. tenure committees). 

It is well known that men tend to be biased against woman in many settings 
(and also women can be biased against women, but less). 
This is one of the reasons why it is now common to have rules 
enforcing that every committee should have at least some quota of women. 
What was surprising to me is that men can be *more* biased against women 
when there is a woman in the committee, which then implies that the committee
as a whole is more biased.
The reason would be that, when a woman is present, men tend to be less 
committed to gender equality, or that their male identity is strengthened.

I had never thought about it before, but in retrospect it feels familiar. 
I have only been in a few committees (namely, two committees for PhD awards), 
and I have not detected this phenomenon, but I did get a feeling of 
"Since there is a person from research area X, I don't need to be very 
careful about not being biased against X". Therefore it is reasonable to 
think that the same would apply to gender. 

Of course this does not mean that we should remove woman quotas for 
committees. I guess the conclusion that there is one more bias mechanism to 
be aware of when being in a committee. 

[If you look for a paper on this, the one I could find is
[Does the Gender Composition of Scientific Committees Matter?](https://docs.iza.org/dp9199.pdf)
published in American Economic Review in 2017, which uses data from 
associate and full professorships committees in Italy and Spain, and 
randomized external evaluation to assess the bias.]
