I've encountered this situation multiple times: I’m part of an informal group with quite a few people, and at some point, I need to send an email to all of them. However, I don’t want to "Reply All" to the last email in the thread, as it’s about a completely different topic. Copying and pasting all the email addresses every time is tedious—so what’s a better way?

Solution: You can create a "local" mailing list on Thunderbird:
which acts as an alias for a set of recipient addresses. Just go in 
the adress book, create a new mailing list, give it some name, and list the 
adresses. Now every time you need to write to this groupe of people, you 
can simply send it to "name-of-your-list". 

This is probably obvious to most people, but after years of manually 
copying addresses, I'm glad I finally looked for a smarter solution.
