Third post about the PODC/DISC 
[young researchers forum](https://sites.google.com/view/youngresearchersforum2025/). 
Here, I will give some details about the schedule and its rationale. 

### General schedule 

We organized the day around three activities: talks by junior
researchers, keynotes by senior researchers and junior-senior meetings. 
In terms of availability (CET time), we had approximately 5 who were 
available only in the morning, 12 only in the afternoon, and 
20 available for both. This was not always correlated to the 
affiliation time zones, some people had other commitments, while others 
had more flexible work hours.

To accommodate as many people as possible, we decided to have a bit of 
everything both in the morning and in the afternoon. The final schedule 
looked like this:

* 9-10: Keynote by Christian Scheideler. 
* 10-11:30: Junior talks. 
* 11:30-12: Two junior-senior meetings in parallel. 
* 12-13: break. 
* 13-13:30: Two junior-senior meetings in parallel
* 13:30-14:30: Junior talks.
* 14:30-14:45: Break
* 14:45-15:45: Junior talks
* 15:45-16:15: Keynote by Peter Davies-Peck
* 16:15-16:30: Closing remarks. 
* 16:30-17:00: Two junior-senior meetings in parallel.

### About junior talks

Given the number of submissions, and to keep the event short enough to be 
pleasant, we allocated 15 minutes per talk, including questions and 
transitions. We had a 6-talk session in the morning, and two
4-talk sessions in the afternoon. 

It worked very well. All speakers stayed on time, 
which was great. The short talk format proved to be a good decision: we could 
understand what everyone was doing, without being exhausted at the end of 
day. Scheduling was driven more by participants' time zones than by talk 
topics, but it was fine.

### About the keynote talks

Initially, we were not sure about having keynotes, since we wanted a 
junior-oriented event. But then it seemed like a good idea to share 
experience and to attract people. They were both very appreciated. 

We had asked Christian to give a talk with accessible open problems, and 
he proposed to share three topics he’s currently interested in, and it was 
a good choice: we could discover emerging topics with many new questions 
and directions. 

For Peter,  we had simply asked him to talk about his exciting new STOC 
paper. Unexpectedly, he chose to focus more on the story behind the paper 
than its technical content—which was great. 
It gave juniors a direct glimpse into the research process, which is 
invisible when one only looks at lists of published papers. 
In particular, Peter told us how some seemingly unrelated topics gave him some 
ideas on the problem, how reviewing some papers was essential, 
how he first got a less prestigious publication that in the end did not 
even use the idea, how he left the topic on the side during postdocs, 
and how he got back to it successfully. 


### About junior-senior meetings

This is a format that Billy has been experimenting at PODC/DISC for some 
time: matching a voluntary senior with a 
bunch of junior for informal discussions, usually over lunch. It's a good way to 
make these discussions happen, and they are very appreciated. 

We wanted to mimick this online. In the end we had six seniors, each meeting 
with group of approx 4 juniors. We made the matching oursleves for 
simplicity, trying to have balanced groups where people would not know 
each other already.
