It is not a new observation that TCS papers are mainly written for reviewers. 
This makes sense, given that researchers want to optimize the 
list of accepted papers. Of course it makes little sense scientifically, 
since most readers will not be reviewers (hopefully!). 

As a reviewer, I like that the authors explicitely discuss the novelty
and difficulty; but as a normal reader, I just want to 
understand the content and get the big picture. A typical example is 
a paper that uses notions that are close to another area of research. As a 
reviewer I want to be sure that the authors are aware of it, and have 
checked the literature, but as a reader, I will just trust the authors (and 
the reviewers). 

In some sense the discussion of the novelty and difficulty should be 
managed in the same way as the boring proofs in journal papers: you want 
them to exist, you want them to be checked by reviewers, but that's not 
what you want to read. 

Unfortunately many TCS papers appear only as 12-page conference paper. 
Sometimes I read a
celebrated paper, which is painfully explaning why what they do is great, 
(of course it is!). It's annoying. 

We could imagine companion papers, where one would write specifically 
to the reviewers to explain in detail the novelty (with an in-depth review 
of the literature), and the technical difficulties (with a discussion 
of how all the known tools fail). 

I tried to have such things in the appendix
of a paper, but even though there were several warnings in the text, a
reviewer did not read it, and said that the technique was well-known (when 
it was not). Maybe having it as a seperate text would avoid this.
