I recently participated in a two-day training on supervising PhD 
students. It was a good experience, and this post is about some insights 
I learned/realized. 

## Training for supervising?	

I admit I didn't high expectations from the training, in the sense that I did 
not feel I lacked essential skills, or that such skills 
could be taught in just a few hours. 
I mostly came because I consider that some people would 
actually need some kind of training/reminder about how to properly 
and respectfully supervise students, and it felt hypocritical to have this 
belief without participating myself.
Actually, there was a proposal to make such training mandatory for all 
PhD supervisors in France, but it was only implemented in specific 
places like ENS Lyon.

In the end,  was it was both enoyable and useful, and I'm glad I decided 
to participate.

For reference, the training (funded by my employer, CNRS) was 
"L'impact de votre encadrement sur le projet de thèse et la relation 
doctorale", organized by Adoc Metis, and the instructor was Aline Waltzing. 
All the ideas come from them, I've just done a selection and 
rephrased things in my own words. 

## Clarity and planning

A recurring theme was the importance of making things explicit.
Many aspects of a PhD, such as roles, rules, goals, timelines are often 
left implicit, and this can create a lot of anxiety. 
 
One of the reasons of this ambiguity is the unique nature of PhD: both a 
continuation of the academic studies and a job.
This hybrid status means that there are no universal standards, unlike for 
standard students or standard employees. 
(There was a discussion about terminology: replacing the term 
"(PhD) student" (or "étudiant" in French) with
doctoral researcher (or "doctorant")  to better acknowledge their status as 
professionals and researchers.)

Since one cannot refer to a standard, it is the role of the PhD supervisor 
to clarify as many things as possible, starting with practical aspects 
such as working hours, vacation policies, and expected behavior (e.g. 
showing up at seminars). Note that these can vary significantly from one 
group to another. 

More generally, it is good to clarify the roles of the student and the 
advisor, what each of them has to do, can do etc. 
One aspect of this topic is that in France (but not everywhere), 
the PhD advisor is not the official manager of the PhD student, 
only the head of the lab is strictly above in the hierarchy, but in practice
the PhD advisor is deciding on the work to be done, and can take action to 
stop the PhD. 

Planning is also a way to clarify
On a small scale, scheduling the next meeting at the end of each session 
gives reassuring milestones.
At a larger scale, it is good to talk about the middle and long-term 
perspectives, and to have some plan. Since the research is mostly about 
failing, plans will almost always become obsolete, but it is good to 
have some general direction, and to be able to update it together. 

## PhD as a learning process 

Another important takeaway was to clearly distinguish between the 
research project and the PhD, as a learning process. 
The usual way to supervise a PhD is to work on the research project together, 
and hope that the student will learn by example. But it is good to 
actually think about the skills that the student will need to learn to 
become a good researcher, and to consider the research project as a kind 
of platform to learn these skills. 

One issue we discussed was that sometimes the learning process and the 
project are in conflict. For example, the supervisor would like to develop 
the writing skills of the student, but because of a looming deadline, 
supervisor takes over and writes the introduction themselves. 
More broadly, the advisor may hesitate to delegate advanced tasks to avoid
losing time or compromising on the quality (or at least their vision of the 
quality).

Ideally one would like to start with assuming that the student knows nothing
and the advisor providing close guidance, and over time the student 
gains the skills to take ownership of larger aspects of the project, while 
the advisor moves to a more consultative role.

## Some general classifications

I also found the following classifications insightful and worth sharing: 

* Psychosocial hazard or work stressor: work intensity and timing 
of work, emotional labor, lack of autonomy, conflict of values, job insecurity

* Sources of motivations: Sense of competence, valuing
the activity, sense of autonomy, perception of control, 
sense of belonging.


## Participants

We were around 10 academics at the training, from diverse areas of science. 
Basically, there were people 
like me, with little experience, and people who were more experienced but had 
faced issues recently in supervising. 
We realize that we are unprepared to supervise students: 
for most of us, the only PhD we have closely observed was our own PhD, and 
even with experience, every PhD presents unique challenges. 
It does not help that most of us are not natural 
managers: we were selected for our research expertise, and often we are 
used to working alone. 

It was nice to share experiences with these nice colleagues and to discuss
differences between the different disciplines.
