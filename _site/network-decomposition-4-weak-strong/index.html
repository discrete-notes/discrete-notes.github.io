  <h1 class="post-title">Network decomposition 4&#58; weak and strong decompositions</h1>
  <span class="post-date">05 May 2020</span>
  <p>This is the fourth post of a series on distributed network decomposition. 
The introductory post of this series is 
<a href="https://discrete-notes.github.io/network-decomposition-0">here</a>.</p>

<p>In this post, we take a look at the different versions of network decomposition
(weak and strong), and how we can go from one to the other.</p>

<h3 id="recap-of-previous-episodes"> Recap of previous episodes</h3>

<p>In the previous posts, we saw what a network decomposition is, why it is useful
to the design of local algorithms and how we can build such object with a 
sequential algorithm. Before we describe the distributed efficient algorithm 
(that is the core of series), let us give a further look at two different types
of decompositions.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-diameter-of-a-component">What is the diameter of a component?</h2>

<p>In the <a href="https://discrete-notes.github.io/network-decomposition-2-impact">second post</a> 
of this series we defined network decompositions, saying that the connected 
components of each color class have diameter at most $d$. 
As usual, the diameter is the maximum over all pairs of nodes of the minimum length
of a path between these two nodes. But which edges can you use for these paths: 
only the edges of the subgraph, or all the edges of the graph? 
The first way defines the <em>strong diameter</em> and the second is the <em>weak diameter</em>.
These can be very different, as pictured below.</p>

<p><img src="assets/strong-weak.png" alt="" class="center-image" width="50%" /></p>
<p align="center"><small><i>
On this graph, the blue component has weak diameter 2 and strong diameter 9.
</i></small></p>

<p>The distributed algorithm we’ll study builds a network decomposition with a 
logarithmic <em>weak diameter</em>.</p>

<h2 id="going-from-weak-to-strong-diameter"> Going from weak to strong diameter</h2>

<p>For some applications it might be better to have a strong decomposition, and the 
algorithm provides only a weak one. This is not a big problem. 
The paper of Rozhon and Ghaffari sketches an approach that builds a strong 
decomposition with $O(\log(n))$ colors from a weak one with also $O(\log(n))$ 
colors. 	
It is even simpler to have such a transformation if we just insist on having 
polylogs: 
take your weak decomposition, make the nodes of each component act like in a 
centralized algorithm (by gathering the whole topology of the component and 
simulating), and make them compute a strong decomposition of the component 
itself. For example take a component of weak diameter with color yellow, the nodes 
of this component a strong network decomposition of this component, in some sense
the nodes of this component now have $\log(n)$ shades of yellow. In total this 
makes a strong decomposition with $O(\log^2n)$ colors.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="assets/refined-decompo-1.png" alt="" class="center-image" width="90%" /></td>
      <td><img src="assets/refined-decompo-2.png" alt="" class="center-image" width="90%" /></td>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p align="center"><small><i>
The first picture is a weak decomposition with two colors, yellow and blue. 
Note that the strong diameter is large in comparison with the weak diameter. Now,
if the yellow component "strongly decompose" itself, we get three shades of 
yellow, and the new yellow components have small strong diameter. We can do this 
for all components of all colors classes, in parallel. 
</i></small></p>

<p>We finish this post with some technical aspects of weak decompositions.</p>

<h2 id="a-tree-to-keep-track-of-the-diameter">A tree to keep track of the diameter</h2>

<p>Remember that for the centralized construction, we create the component by making 
the balls grow layers by layers. Now suppose that we would build a spanning tree
of the component as we go: at each new layer, we would wire the nodes as leafs 
of the tree. The depth of this tree is between half the diameter and the 
diameter.</p>

<p><img src="assets/boule-arbre-1.png" alt="" class="center-image" width="70%" /></p>
<p align="center"><small><i>
The nodes of a component, added layers by layers, during the growth of a ball, 
for the centralized construction. The orange edges are the edges of the tree, 
the gray edges are other edges of the component. The diameter is 5, and the depth of 
the tree is 4. 
</i></small></p>

<p>In the distributed network decomposition, some balls will grow in a similar 
fashion as in the centralized algorithm, but then they will be modified. In 
particular some nodes will leave the component. Also, as we want the tree to have a 
depth that bounds the weak diameter, this tree may have to use edges 
that are not within the component. Hence we use a Steiner tree using the edges 
and nodes that may not be in the component.</p>

<p><img src="assets/boule-arbre-2.png" alt="" class="center-image" width="70%" /></p>
<p align="center"><small><i>
The blue patches show the balls of various distance from the root, using the 
nodes and edges of all the graph. In particular the yellow nodes are not part of 
the component, but they are used by the tree.
</i></small></p>

<h2 id="giving-up-the-connectivity">Giving up the connectivity</h2>

<p>Actually now that we measure the diameter via the tree, we can consider 
non-connected components.</p>

<p><img src="assets/boule-arbre-3.png" alt="" class="center-image" width="70%" /></p>

<p>This change in the definition useful in the distributed algorithm as we don’t 
want to keep track of whether the component is connected or not.</p>
