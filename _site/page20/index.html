<h2 id="queue-number-again-and-applications">Queue number again, and applications</h2>

<p>A recent result about the so-called <em>queue number</em> was mentioned on this blog in March 
(see <a href="./stoc-socg-picks">here</a>). The result says that this graph parameter is bounded 
on planar graph that have bounded degree.
The result has now been generalized to any planar graph! 
The <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.04791.pdf">paper is on arxiv</a> and will be presented 
at FOCS 2019.
I haven’t looked into the paper, but I know from 
<a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/08/10/report-from-cccg.html">David Epptein’s blog</a> 
that it is a byproduct of showing that “every planar graph is a subgraph of a strong 
product of a path graph and a bounded-treewidth graph”.</p>

<p>Another <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.03341">recent paper on the arxiv</a> 
uses this result to design shorter labeling schemes for planar graphs.
As the abstract says: 
“In graph-theoretical terms, this implies an explicit construction 
of a graph on $n^{4/3}+o(1)$ vertices that contains all planar graphs 
on n vertices as induced subgraphs”.
(Thanks to Cyril Gavoille for pointing out this paper.)</p>

<h2 id="unfolding-polytopes-durers-conjecture">Unfolding polytopes: Durer’s Conjecture</h2>

<p>Given a polyhedra, one can cut along the edges to unfold it on the plane as in the following drawing.</p>

<p><img src="assets/durer-1.jpg" alt="" class="center-image" width="90%" /></p>

<p>But sometimes, if you cut along some edges, you may have an overlap in the unfolding, as the
second unfolding of the 
following  example (borrowed from <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Unfolding.html">here</a>) shows.</p>

<p><img src="assets/durer-2.jpg" alt="" class="center-image" width="90%" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.openproblemgarden.org/op/d_urers_conjecture">Durer’s conjecture</a> states that 
“Every convex polytope has a non-overlapping edge unfolding”.
A non-overlapping edge unfolding is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_(polyhedron)">a net</a>, 
so the conjecture can be reformulated as: “Every convex polytope has a net”.
It is surprising that such a cute and simple result is still open.</p>

<p>I learned about this conjecture in 
<a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/08/10/report-from-cccg.html">Eppstein’s report on CCCG</a>.

<h2 id="more-on-graphs-inspired-by-objects-and-nature">More on graphs inspired by objects and nature</h2>

<p>We had a <a href="./april-may-2019-notes">post in april</a> on graphs that have some meaning 
in terms of real-world objects.</p>

<p>Two additional pointers on this topic:
* a <a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2013/12/07/kinematic-chains-and.html">blog post</a> about graph that have one degree of freedom when you want to move them.
* the <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/pubs/Epp-WADS-19.pdf">slides</a> of a talk about graphs inspired by nature, for example by crystals and by bubbles.</p>

<p><img src="assets/cristaux-bulles.jpg" alt="" class="center-image" width="80%" /></p>
<p align="center"><small><i>
The red circles are the nodes on the right drawing, but on the left ones they are part of the procedure to draw the crystals. See the slides for more details.
</i></small></p>

<h2 id="automata-size-to-separate-two-words">Automata size to separate two words</h2>

<p>Yet another very simple and still open problem: consider two strings of length $n$, what is the size of the smallest deterministic automaton than accepts one and rejects the other? 
Or more precisely, what is the maximum over all such pairs of this size? 
The upper bound is polynomial in $n$ (something like $\sqrt(n)$) and the lower bound is $\Omega(\log n)$. An exponential gap!</p>

<p>For more on this see these two posts by Lipton: <a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/09/08/separating-words-by-automata/">here</a> and
<a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2019/09/16/separating-words-decoding-a-paper/">there</a>.</p>

<h2 id="other-notes">Other notes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The paper about the matching lower bound that I mentioned here several times won the best paper award at FOCS! I think it’s a remarkable research story: identifying a fundamental problem, telling everybody about it, learning more and more, and finally solving it, and getting an award for it!</li>
  <li>Some day, I’ll learn about spanners, I hope. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.03152.pdf">Here</a> is a recent survey that may help.</li>
  <li>A <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05257">paper appeared on the arxiv</a> on the recognition of intersection graphs of objects touching a diagonal line, related to <a href="https://www.dii.uchile.cl/~feuilloley/publications/rectangles_DCG15.html">this paper of mine</a>.</li>
