        Simulation argument IV. Maximal matching
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">15 Feb 2019</span>

    <p>This is the fourth and last post of a series about the simulation argument, that 
started with <a href="./simulation-1">this post</a>.</p>

<hr />

<p><img src="assets/puzzle-4.png" alt="" class="center-image" width="50%" /></p>

<hr />

<p>In this post we tackle the maximal matching problem. 
Or actually we will show 
why establishing a lower bound for this problem is not as easy as for the 
sinkless orientation problem. 
The real lower bound is in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02441">this paper</a>.</p>

<h3 id="encoding">Encoding</h3>

<p>A maximal matching is a set of edges of the graph, such that no two of these
edges are adjacent, and no two unmatched node are linked by an edge.</p>

<p><img src="assets/couplage.png" alt="" class="center-image" width="100%" /></p>

<p>A natural encoding for this problem would be to label the edges of the matching 
with a label $A$, and edges not in the matching with a label $B$. 
But this does not work for our setting. 
Instead, we will do the following. 
(As in the previous post we will deal with 2-colored trees.)</p>

<ul>
  <li>The edges of the matching are labeled with the label $M$.</li>
  <li>If a white node is not matched then its edges are labeled with $P$. 
These are pointers to matched black nodes.</li>
  <li>The remaining edges are labeled with $O$.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the following picture, red edges are for $M$, green edges are for $P$, and 
blue edges are for $O$ (the missing edge should be blue!).</p>

<p><img src="assets/couplage-2.png" alt="" class="center-image" width="60%" /></p>

<p>The languages we use are then described by the following polynomials:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$L_W = MO^{\Delta-1}+P^{\Delta}$,</li>
  <li>$L_B = M(P+O)^{\Delta-1} + O^{\Delta}$.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="transformation">Transformation</h2>

<h3 id="simulation">Simulation</h3>

<p>We perform the simulation on a black node $u$, and get a polynomial $P_u$.<br />
By definition $P_u\subseteq (M+O+P)^{\Delta}$, and is factorized.</p>

<h3 id="product-property">Product property</h3>

<p>As the product rule applies, we know that
$P_u \subseteq M(P+0)^{\Delta-1}+O^{\Delta}$.<br />
Thus there is at most one factor of $P_u$ with an $M$.</p>

<p><em>Claim 1</em>: This factor is either $(M)$ or $(M+O)$.</p>

<p><em>Proof</em>: Suppose the factor with $M$ has a $P$. 
Then it means that when we develop $P_u$,
there are two monomials $M\times K$ and $P\times K$, with $K$ a polynomial
of degree $\Delta-1$, that does not contain an $M$. 
But the monomial $P\times K$ is not included in 
$M(P+0)^{\Delta-1}+O^{\Delta}$. which contradicts the product property.</p>

<p>Then we are left with 5 possible sums as factors in $P_u$: 
$(M), (O), (P), (M+O), (P+0)$.</p>

<p>Now it seems that we cannot get much more out of our properties, so let’s try a 
simplification step.</p>

<h3 id="tentative-simplification-step">(Tentative) Simplification step</h3>

<p>If we can map $(M+O)$ and $(P+O)$ to a simple label, 
and still match the language, 
then we are done, and we can conclude like in the <a href="./simulation-3">previous post</a>. 
But this is not going to happen.</p>

<p>Suppose you are in following situation, which is supposed to be easy because 
there is not even a $(P+O)$. (On the picture, every black node writes on its 
adjacent edges.)</p>

<p><img src="assets/couplage-3.png" alt="" class="center-image" width="60%" /></p>

<p>Ok, let’s just take one of the two edges labeled with $M+O$
(let say the one with the smallest port-number on the white node), 
label it with $M$, label the other one with $O$, and we are done.</p>

<p>This does notwork.
The problem is the one we highlighted in the <a href="./simulation-2">second post</a>: 
the edges are not uniformly set-labeled by all the nodes. 
A concrete bad case:</p>

<ul>
  <li>let $(u,v)$ and $(v,w)$ be the two edges labeled by $(M+0)$</li>
  <li>in its simulation, $u$ has (M+O) for both edges, and based on port-numbers, 
decides that $(u,v)$ gets $M$.</li>
  <li>in its simulation $w$ has $(M+O)$ for $(v,w)$, but only $(O)$ for $(u,v)$. Thus 
it labels $(v,w)$ with $M$.</li>
</ul>

<p>To solve this problem you have to synchronize, and this is forbidden as it takes 
extra time.</p>

<h2 id="no-lower-bound-this-way">No lower bound this way</h2>

<p>So at the end, we cannot conclude like in the case of sinkless orientation.</p>

<p>Comments on that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>This makes sense: actually there is a $O(\Delta)$ 
algorithm for this problem, thus no $\Omega(\log n)$ lower bound exists.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The above alone does not prove that there is no $\Omega(\log n)$ lower 
bound: we could use another definition of the problem, or we could have tried 
more exotic label replacement ($M$ transformed into $P$, or whatever).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you want to prove a $\Omega(\Delta)$ lower bound then you need to be 
smarter. In particular you need that, after the transformation, the language is 
different. Basically there should be a parameter that starts with something like 
$\Delta$ and decreases at each transformation. 
For that, see <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02441">the paper</a>!</p>
  </li>
</ul>
