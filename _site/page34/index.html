<h2 id="maximal-matching-lower-bound">Maximal matching lower bound</h2>

<p>They did it! A key problem of distributed computing on graphs has 
been solved by a team supervised by
<a href="https://users.ics.aalto.fi/suomela/">Jukka Suomela</a>. 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02441">The preprint</a> has been 
uploaded to arxiv recently, and is not reviewed yet, so this should be taken 
with a grain of salt, but given the authors list, and what I have read of the 
paper, there is little doubt it is correct.</p>

<p>The setting can be explained the following way. There are jobs available,
and people looking for jobs. Every job has at most $\Delta$ candidates, 
and each person has at most $\Delta$ jobs (s)he is interested in. 
There is no central entity, so the decisions of which job is matched
to which person have to be taken based on communication 
between the “jobs” and the people. 
At the end, we want that (1) every person
either has been assigned a job or all the jobs (s)he was interested in have been 
assigned to someone else, and (2) every job is either assigned to someone, or all 
the candidates for this job have been assigned another job. 
Note that there is no preference list, and that
this problem would be very easy if we had a central entity managing the job 
market.</p>

<p>A strategy to solve the problem is the following: first every person chooses a 
job among the ones it has selected, and sends a proposal to this job, second the 
“jobs” choose one of the persons that have sent a proposal to it (if any). 
After this first round, some people and jobs are already matched, and they leave 
the game. 
The other jobs and persons continue, until we have reached a situation that 
fulfils the conditions (1) and (2) above.</p>

<p>This strategy requires $O(\Delta)$ phases. The new result tells us
that this is basically optimal.</p>

<h2 id="search-vs-decision">Search vs decision</h2>

<p>My PhD was about distributed decision, and a sentence that often appears in 
papers on this topic is some variation of “unlike in the centralized setting,
search and decision are very different in the distributed setting”. This makes
me a bit uncomfortable because I don’t have a very strong statement to support 
the claim that in centralized computing search and decision are similar.</p>

<p>Lance Fortnow 
<a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/01/search-versus-decision.html">blogged about this</a> 
early this month.</p>

<h2 id="fragile-complexity">Fragile complexity</h2>

<p>An interesting recent line of research is to go “beyond worst-case complexity”, 
that is to consider other measures of complexity/efficiency than the time on the
worst input, as the later can be inadequate for many purposes.
There are very nice concepts there, such as the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoothed_analysis">smoothed complexity</a>. 
See also the <a href="http://timroughgarden.org/f14/l/top10.pdf">top 10 ideas</a> in this 
area, by <a href="http://timroughgarden.org/">Tim Roughgarden</a>.</p>

<p>A new measure was introduced in 
<a href="https://export.arxiv.org/abs/1901.02857">an arxiv preprint</a> this month: fragile 
complexity. I just read the abstract, and I don’t know why it is called ‘fragile’, 
but I understand the definition for sorting: the fragile complexity of a sorting
algorithm is the maximal number of comparisons that an element of the list can 
be part of.</p>

<h2 id="lipics-without-logos">LIPIcs without logos</h2>

<p>I like LIPIcs latex class, which is now used for many conferences (basically the 
ones that switched to open access). 
I would like to use 
it for my preprints (because it looks nice, and because if the conference is in 
lipics, it avoids extra-work). One problem is that preprints should not have the
official lipics logos, and other feature that are relevant only for conference 
publications. 
Following the example of a colleague, I used to use a modified version of the 
class file. This is not useful any more: the class now provides the command 
\hideLIPIcs that hides the conference-only features. (See the
<a href="http://drops.dagstuhl.de/styles/lipics-v2019/lipics-v2019-authors/lipics-v2019-authors-guidelines.pdf">authors guidelines</a>, 
page 8.)</p>

<h2 id="pac-learning-and-deep-learning">PAC learning and deep learning</h2>

<p>It seems that deep learning is becoming popular among almost everybody (at least 
from a scientific point of view), except theoretical computer scientists, who 
criticize it for its lack of proven guarantees. As a reaction, 
there are several efforts to better understand ML from a theoretical point of 
view (for example in <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/madry/lab/">Alexander Mądry’s group</a>
and in the <a href="http://mltheory.cs.princeton.edu/">ML theory group at Princeton</a>).</p>

<p>The month in the Theory Dish blog, Amit Daniely and Roy Frostig 
<a href="https://theorydish.blog/2019/01/04/on-pac-analysis-and-deep-neural-networks/">blog about</a>
the performances of deep learning on well-defined theoretical tasks in the 
context of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probably_approximately_correct_learning">PAC learning</a>.</p>

<p>Incidentally, Leslie Valiant published a <a href="http://www.probablyapproximatelycorrect.com/">book</a>
about PAC learning (that he defined in the eighties), and its relation with 
nature and evolution.</p>

<h2 id="wind-turbines-machine-learning-and-algorithms">Wind turbines, machine learning and algorithms</h2>

<p>Lance Fortnow also <a href="https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2019/01/machine-learning-and-wind-turbines.html">blogged about wind turbines and ML</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, a problem for wind turbines is to predict sudden changes of the wind, 
that could cause damage. One could use complex fluid simulations, but these are 
slow therefore there is an increasing trend in using ML for these predictions.</p>

<p>So there is a way to make things in a “deterministic” well-defined way, but one 
prefers the ML version that is quicker. 
This reminds me of a 
<a href="https://cstheory.stackexchange.com/questions/38095/if-machine-learning-techniques-keep-improving-whats-the-role-of-algorithmics-i">stack exchange topic</a>
that was basically asking: will algorithms be really useful in the future, knowing
that most of the time we are interested in “good enough” solution, and that we 
don’t even want some approximation guarantees, or even worse, we want solutions 
that are good, with the definition of good given only by examples. Unfortunately 
there were not many answers…</p>

<h2 id="power-diagrams-to-represents-fluids">Power diagrams to represents fluids</h2>

<p><a href="https://11011110.github.io/blog/2019/01/15/linkage.html">11011110 blog</a> links 
to
<a href="https://twitter.com/BrunoLevy01/status/1080085027210309632">nice fluid simulations</a>
using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_diagram">power diagram</a>, 
to picture units of fluid. Power diagrams are generalizations of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram">Voronoi diagrams</a> but special 
cases of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_Voronoi_diagram">weighted Voronoi diagrams</a>.</p>

<h2 id="order-types">Order types</h2>

<p>Suppose you have a configuration with four points in the plane, such that no 
three of them are aligned. Then, either all the points are extreme points, and 
they form a kind of quadrilateral, or there are three points forming a triangle, 
and the last point is in the triangle. These two cases are called the order types
(for four points in the plane). As you can expect, this gets more tricky when 
you look at more points.</p>

<p>There was a <a href="https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/1.9781611975482.27">paper at SODA 2019</a>
about this topic.</p>
