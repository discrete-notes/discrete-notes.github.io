        Network decomposition 2&#58; Impact on distributed algorithms
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">10 Apr 2020</span>

    <p>This is the second post of a series on distributed network decomposition. 
The introductory post of this series is 
<a href="https://discrete-notes.github.io/network-decomposition-0">here</a>. 
This post explains why network decomposition is useful.</p>

<p><img src="assets/caravane-2.jpg" alt="" class="center-image" width="90%" /></p>

<h3 id="recap-of-previous-episodes">Recap of previous episodes</h3>

<p>We saw in the 
<a href="https://discrete-notes.github.io/network-decomposition-1-local-algorithms">first post</a> 
of the series that one can simulate the greedy centralized algorithm in the local 
model, by using the identifiers as a schedule, but that this was horribly slow.
We also looked at an algorithm that gather the whole topology of the graph, this
will be useful here.</p>

<h2 id="everything-is-easier-with-a-coloring">Everything is easier with a coloring</h2>

<p>It is easy to see how we could use less time steps to run the greedy algorithm: 
if you have two nodes that are far enough one from the other, you can select 
both without running into trouble. And then instead of two, you can select a
large number of nodes, as long as they are far away one from the other. 
This way in one round you can select and de-select a lot of nodes.</p>

<p>Now, more generally, imagine that a mysterious friend gives you a (proper) 
$k$-coloring of the graph. You can use it to parallelize the algorithm the 
following way. First, pick the first color, select all of its nodes, de-select 
all the nodes adjacent to these nodes. This cannot create a problem as the nodes
of a color class cannot be adjacent. Then continue by doing the same with the 
nodes of the second color that are still active. And so on and so 
forth, until you have considered all the colors.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="assets/MIS-coloring-1.png" alt="" class="center-image" width="100%" /></td>
      <td><img src="assets/MIS-coloring-2.png" alt="" class="center-image" width="100%" /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="assets/MIS-coloring-3.png" alt="" class="center-image" width="100%" /></td>
      <td><img src="assets/MIS-coloring-4.png" alt="" class="center-image" width="100%" /></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This algorithm basically takes $k$ times steps, which is awesome if your mysterious 
friend gave you a 10-coloring.</p>

<p>Now there are two problems:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You do not have a mysterious friend, and computing a good coloring yourself is 
essentially as hard as computing the MIS.</li>
  <li>The graph might not be colorable with a small number of colors: maybe it’s
chromatic number is $n/2$, and then the algorithm takes $n/2$ rounds, which is 
not much better than before.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="network-decomposition-to-the-rescue">Network decomposition to the rescue</h2>

<p>The idea of network decomposition is to relax the strong constraints of a 
coloring into something more handy, while keeping the idea of a schedule of the 
type:</p>

<ol>
  <li>All nodes of group 1 do something and all the others are passive. At the end 
of this phase, they all have an output.</li>
  <li>All nodes of group 2 do something and all the others are passive. At the end 
of this phase, they all have an output.</li>
  <li>Etc.</li>
</ol>

<p>In a nework decomposition, instead of having a coloring “at the level of the nodes” that 
is where every node has a color different from its neighbors, we will color 
clusters of nodes and have a coloring “at the level of the clusters”. In some 
sense we change scale. A network decomposition looks a bit like this.</p>

<p><img src="assets/impact-decompo-6.png" alt="" class="center-image" width="50%" /></p>

<p>Now there are three questions: What is exactly a network decomposition? 
How to use it? and How to compute it?</p>

<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>

<p><em>Definition</em> A network decomposition with parameters $c$ and $d$ is a labeling of 
the nodes with colors from 1 to $c$, such that for any given color, the (maximal)
connected components with this color have diameter at most $d$.</p>

<p><img src="assets/impact-decompo-5.png" alt="" class="center-image" width="50%" /></p>

<p>[There are some subtleties with the definition, but let’s wait a bit before 
looking into that.]</p>

<p>So for example a proper $k$-coloring is a network decomposition with parameter 
$d=1$ and $c=k$. Also it is easy to have a network decomposition with parameters
$d=n$ and $c=1$: color all nodes with color 1. 
In all this series of posts, what we will look for is a decomposition where both 
parameters are (poly)logarithmic in $n$.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-it">How to use it?</h2>

<p>We cannot use the exact same strategy as when we had a proper coloring. Indeed, 
in a network decomposition several nodes of the same color can be adjacent, thus 
they cannot just wake up and select themselves. 
Now it’s useful to remember the last part of the previous post about a general
algorithm to solve any problem in time $O(n)$. 
Basically this algorithm was doing the following: at any point in time, every 
node sends to its neighbors everything it knows about the graph so far. Then
steps by steps we have the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>When it starts a node knows only its identifier, and it sends it to its 
neighbors.</li>
  <li>Then it receives the identifiers of its neighbors, thus in some sense it knows 
the graph at distance one around itself: it knows its degree and the IDs of its 
neighbors.</li>
  <li>Then the node sends this information to its neighbors, and it recives the 
analogue information from its neighbors. With this, it can reconstruct its 
neighborhood at distance 2. That is, it is exactly the same as if it could see 
at distance 2 in the graph.</li>
  <li>Iterating this process, after $k$ steps all nodes know their neighborhoods 
at distance $k$.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the proof of the general $O(n)$ algorithm, we iterated this process until 
every node could see all the graph. That is we waited for $D$ steps, where $D$ 
is the diameter of the graph (and then as $D \leq n$, we got the result). But this 
process can be useful even if we do not wait up to $D$ rounds, that is, even if 
the nodes do not see the whole graph.</p>

<p>Given the network decomposition, let’s start by activating all the nodes of 
color 1. Now use the protocol above, for $d$ rounds. After this time, a node of
color 1 knows all the nodes of its connected component. Indeed it can see at 
distance $d$ and we have been promised that the diameter of each connected 
component is at most $d$. Once this is done, we ask each node of the connected 
component to forget about the rest of the graph, to compute an MIS in what 
remains, and to output whether it is selected or not in this MIS. Note that it 
is exactly the same thing as what we did in the previous post but on a subgraph.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="assets/impact-decompo-1.png" alt="" class="center-image" width="100%" /></td>
      <td><img src="assets/impact-decompo-3.png" alt="" class="center-image" width="100%" /></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>At the end of the phase, we have only selected and non-selected nodes in all the 
connected components of the first color. Note that these local MIS are correct, 
in the sense that there is no conflict: two connected components are necessarily 
non-adjacent (otherwise they wouldn’t be maximal). To finish this phase with the 
first color class, we de-select the nodes of the other color classes that are 
adjacent to a newly selected node of the first color class. After this step, all
these nodes will not participate in the computation, and we can imagine that 
they are removed from the graph</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="assets/impact-decompo-2.png" alt="" class="center-image" width="100%" /></td>
      <td><img src="assets/impact-decompo-4.png" alt="" class="center-image" width="100%" /></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>We can iterate this for all the color classes, just as we did when we had a 
proper coloring. Let us check the complexity. For each color we need the view at 
distance $d$, which takes $d$ rounds, and there are $c$ colors, so we have an 
algorithm in basically $d\times c$ rounds. As we look for a network decomposition 
with polylogarithmic parameters, this gives us a polylogarithmic algorithm, 
which is awesome!</p>

<p>But now we need to be able to build the network decomposition fast. This is the 
core topic of this series of posts.</p>
