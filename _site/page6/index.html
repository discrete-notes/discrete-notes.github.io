        Bayesian mechanism design and Yao's principle

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">21 Nov 2019</span>

    <p>I attended a talk yesterday about 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_game_theory">algorithmic game theory</a> by 
<a href="https://www.or.tum.de/en/group/alexandrostsigonias/">Alexandros Tsigonias-Dimitriadis</a>
as part of Santiago’s <a href="http://www.dii.uchile.cl/acgo/seminar-acgo/">AGCO seminar</a>.
Here are a few elements from this talk.</p>

<h2 id="basic-bayesian-auction">Basic Bayesian auction</h2>

<p>The very basic setting we are looking at is the following: a client (the bidder)
comes to a seller (the auctioneer) with the goal of buying a particular item. 
The auctioneer has to set a price for the item. 
The bidder knows the maximum price at which she will buy the object (the value 
of the item for her).
If the auctioneer’s price is higher than the bidder’s value, the bidder does not 
buy the item, and if the price is lower then the bidder buys it, but the 
auctioneer “loses” the difference.</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian-optimal_mechanism">Bayesian setting</a>, 
the bidder’s value is taken following a probability 
distribution, and the auctioneer knows this distribution. 
Then, the expected revenue of the auctioneer is the price she announces, 
multiplied by the probability that this price is lower than the value taken by 
the bidder. In other words, if $F$ is the cumulative probability distribution 
of the value of the bidder, 
then the expected revenue for a price $p$ is $p \cdot (1-F(p))$.
Then the auctioneer chooses a price $p$ that maximizes this quantity.</p>

<h2 id="generalizations">Generalizations</h2>

<p>One can generalize this to work with several bidders. This is called 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian-optimal_mechanism#The_Myerson_mechanism">Myerson mechanism</a>.</p>

<p>The paper of Alexandros and his co-authors 
(<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04220">Robust Revenue Maximization Under Minimal Statistical Information</a>)
goes into another direction and explores the setting where the 
auctioneer does not know the full distribution of the bidder, but 
only the mean and an upper bound on the standard deviation. (That’s why it 
is called <em>robust</em> revenue maximization.) Later they extend it to one 
bidder buying (or not) several items.</p>

<p>They show matching upper and lower bounds, and their lower bound
is based on an argument similar to Yao’s minimax principle.</p>

<h2 id="minimax-principle">Minimax principle</h2>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yao%27s_principle">Yao’s minimax principle</a> 
is a general theorem for randomized algorithms. 
Basically it is saying that the best randomized algorithm on its worst instance 
will get the same performance as the best deterministic algorithm on the worst 
distribution of instances. (This needs a precise statement, to say which thing is 
optimized first etc.).</p>

<p>In the context of Alexandros, the instances are distributions (of which we know
only the mean and an upper bound on the standard deviation) thus a 
distribution of instances is a distribution of distributions. 
This can be made precise, by considering a mixture of distributions.</p>
